It allows you to create links to related repositories, make changes and sync them, and provides functionality to customise and apply other CLI commands to these repositories. What is Gameta? Gameta is a play on the word gamete (reproductive cells), and similar to how gametes form the building blocks for life, gameta helps to manage the many repositories that form the building blocks for more complex software. System Requirements Gameta requires Python 3.6+, it is designed to be multi-platform but currently is only tested in Linux environments. Installation Gameta can be easily installed and updated via pip: $ pip install gameta # install $ pip install -U gameta # update Getting Started Getting started is really easy. gameta init gameta init -g # To initialise directory as a Git repo Gameta will extract git information and create the .meta file which stores all your project configurations. { projects : { gameta : { path : . , tags : [ metarepo ], url : https://github.com:genius-systems/gameta.git } } } Note If your project has not been initialised with Git, you can specify the --git or -g flag to perform a git init, but you will have to update the repository URL manually later on. If your repository contains a .meta file generated by Gameta, simply run the following command to sync all linked repositories locally: gameta sync Adding a Repository Run the following command to add a new repository. gameta repo add -n GitPython -u https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython.git -p GitPython Note The path variable is the relative path within the metarepo itself You should see another entry under the projects object within the .meta file { projects : { gameta : { path : . , tags : [ metarepo ], url : git@github.com:genius-systems/gameta.git }, GitPython : { path : GitPython , tags : [ a , b , c ], url : https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython.git } } } You should also see the repository cloned to the relative path specified Applying commands Gameta provides a powerful toolkit to manage your set of repositories. gameta apply -c git fetch --all --tags --prune -c git merge The command above applies the following to all repositories: Fetches all git updates, tags and prunes redundant git artifacts Merges changes on the default branch There's alot more that you can do with commands, see the Applying Commands page for more information Best practices Learn how to leverage on Gameta's capabilities in the Best Practices page","title":"Home"},{"location":"#gameta","text":"Gameta is a powerful CLI tool that helps you to manage meta-repositories or metarepos .

A metarepo is a repository that contains links to other related repositories. It does not contain the source code of the related repositories, but can acquire this whenever required. Gameta stores links to the git repositories of the child repositories and clones them whenever a sync command is run. Metarepos can serve as a consolidating repository for a particular system, project or organisation i.e. system-level dependencies, build, deployment and release scripts are stored here. A nice article discussing metarepos can be found here . Monorepos A dichotomy exists in the way we store and manage code at present. At one end of the spectrum we have the monorepo, a single repository containing all source code within a project or organisation. The monorepo has various advantages, for instance project discovery, dependencies and versioning are much simpler to manage. However, this comes at the expense of complicated, customised tooling, increasing complexity when scaling and upgrading the system and long CI/CD build times. Proponents of this methodology include companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, many of whom can afford huge teams to customise tools to manage such an ecosystem. Multirepos At the other end of the spectrum, we have the multirepo architecture, where source code is split across many repositories. In this paradigm, the advantages and disadvantages of the monorepo are reversed i.e. the project is dissociated into smaller organised parts and these parts becomes easier to manage, whereas coordinating all these fragmented pieces of software becomes a nightmare. Metarepos Metarepos provide a middle ground between these 2 polar extremes. Source code is stored across many repositories, allowing the organisation to capitalise on the benefits of a multirepo architecture. The fragmented code landscape is pieced together in a single repository or metarepo that stores links to the relevant code bases rather than the actual code itself. Actual code is pulled from the child repositories whenever required e.g. during build and delivery, enabling users to capitalise on the benefits of a monorepo architecture.","title":"Metarepos"},{"location":"metarepos/#what-is-a-metarepo","text":"A metarepo is a repository that contains links to other related repositories.

Contributions can be made in a number of ways, a few examples are: Code patches via pull requests Documentation improvements Bug reports and patch reviews Code of Conduct Everyone interacting in the Gameta's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the PyPA Code of Conduct . Reporting an Issue Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and Gameta version. If you get an error please include the full error and traceback. Testing the Development Version If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of Gameta you can do so with the following command. This can be useful if you want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you have encountered is fixed in the git master. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv . pip install git+https://github.com/genius-systems/gameta.git@master Installing for Development First you'll need to fork and clone the repository. Once you have a local copy, run the following command. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv . pip install --editable . This will install Gameta in development mode which binds the gameta command to the git repository. Running the tests To run the tests, it is recommended that you use tox . Install Tox using pip by running the command pip install tox . Then the test suite can be run with the command tox in the root of your Gameta repository. It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we support. So don't be concerned if you are missing some and they fail. The rest will be verified when you submit a pull request. Submitting Pull Requests Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"about/contributing/#contributing-to-gameta","text":"Gameta welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers and users in the open source community.

There are 3 parts to this section: Applying CLI Commands Applying Python Commands Parameterising CLI Commands Using Gameta Commands Applying Commands By default, Gameta applies CLI commands to all repositories (metarepo and all child repos). It also provides the flexibility to apply them to a user-defined selection of these repositories. There are 2 ways users can select repositories: Applying to Tagged Repositories Applying to Selected Repositories Applying to Tagged Repositories Tags provide a means to group and organise your child repositories and apply CLI commands selectively to these repositories. Supposing that one has the following .meta file: { projects : { gameta : { path : . , tags : [ metarepo ], url : git@github.com:genius-systems/gameta.git }, GitPython : { path : GitPython , tags : [ git ], url : https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython.git }, gitdb : { path : core/gitdb , tags : [ git , core ], url : https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitdb.git } } } If you only want to build the Python repositories tagged with git, you can run the following command: gameta apply -c python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel -t git Applying to Selected Repositories Users can apply a CLI command directly to a specified set of repositories, without needing to create tags. The same effect as described above can be achieved with the following command: gameta apply -c python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel -r GitPython -r gitdb Applying Python Commands From version 0.2.2 , Gameta can apply Python 3 scripts across various repositories. This provides users with the flexibility to augment their CLI operations with Python scripts. Python scripts are entered similar to multi-line shell commands using the '' . Consider the Python script below that: Generates an encryption key of configurable length (using the KEY_LEN constant) consisting of only ASCII variables Writes the key to all repositories (using the reserved __repos__ variable) to a configurable file name (using the ENCRYPTION_FILE_NAME constant) gameta apply -p -c ' from os import getcwd from os.path import join from random import choice from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits, punctuation key = .join([choice(ascii_lowercase + ascii_uppercase + digits + punctuation) for _ in range({KEY_LEN})]) for repo, details in {__repos__}.items(): with open(join(getcwd(), details[ path ], {ENCRYPTION_FILE_NAME} ), w ) as f: f.write(key) ' -r main_repo Note If the --python / -p flag is used, all commands entered (with the -c parameter) in the same execution must be Python scripts. Note When writing Python scripts, use double quotes for all Python strings in the script as issues may arise when the command is applied due to string escaping. Parameterising Commands CLI parameterisation is quintessential to support more complex operations. There are 3 types of parameters that can be substituted: Parameters : These are unique to each repository and are conventionally stored in lower case.

These are added via the gameta const add command (see Commands ).
